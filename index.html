    <p>Hi, my name is Arina. I am a sophmore, majoring in human biology which is not connected to art, but I was always interested in it.  In my live photography is a hobby and a way for me to observe and capture the world around me. I am drawn to moments that feel natural and unforced, focusing on everyday scenes. I enjoy traveling and exploring the streets, working with natural light, street life, trying to capture atmosphere and emotion. For me, photography is not about creating perfect images, but about preserving a specific feeling, moment that exists in real time.
I am especially interested in photographing ordinary environments and details that people tend to overlook. These small moments, light hitting a surface, overlayed writing and posters on the wall with a touching quote, or quiet pauses in daily life that allow me to explore how meaning can exist in simple things. Photography helps me slow down in a running megapolis and pay closer attention to the surroundings, turning it into a creative practice. In this class, I want to develop a more intentional approach to image making while continuing to treat photography as an expressive and exploratory hobby. I hope to strengthen my visual awareness and better understand how photography can communicate personal experience without relying on words.</p>
